# PROJECT PROPOSAL

# The Big Idea

The main idea of my project is to let NBA fans better understand the greatness of Michael Jordan's career. Specifically, minimum viable product (MVP) will be a search engine. When the user enters a specific season, the system will feedback Jordan's specific statistics and honors for that season.

---

# Learning Objectives

I hope that I can skillfully use Python and API to extract data and display them through Flask.

---

# Implementation Plan

The search engine MVP will be built using Python and Flask. The backend will utilize the NBA Stats API to retrieve Michael Jordan's career data per season.

---

# Project Schedule

week1: 
1. Build out backend to retrieve Jordan's career stats data from NBA API
2. Set up Flask
3. Implement season search endpoint

week2:
1. Create search page with input form
2. Display returned stats data cleanly on results page
3. Add basic visualizations of season stats(considering)

week3:
1. Refine search interface with better layouts and UX
2. Expand search features and options
3. Testing and bug fixes

# Collaboration Plan

Solo working.

# Risks and Limitations

1. The NBA Stats API may not provide full coverage of all MJ stats and accolades through his career. 
2. I may be new to some of the web development tech like Flask and PostgreSQL.
3. I am not sure whether I can effectively visualize and present Jordan's season stats.
4. A simple search engine will make the user experience very poor. I may want to consider adding player comparison.
